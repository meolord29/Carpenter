# ADR-016: `upgrade` fetches the published release

Date: 2026-08-17 · Status: Accepted

## Context

`upgrade` was source-only (adr/004): resolve `--source` → config `source_dir` →
`ValidationError`; rebuild via `cargo xtask build --release`. That fit
source-checkout users, but `.github/workflows/release.yml` now publishes a
checksum-verified `edge` release for every push to `main`, and
`scripts/install.sh` installs it — so binary-installed users had **no upgrade
path** (`upgrade` errored without a checkout; the installer's "update" story was
"re-run install.sh", which never updated the skill file).

ADR-004 also deliberately kept "git out of upgrade" — fetching a release does
not reintroduce git: it fetches **tarballs over HTTPS with checksum
verification**, not a clone.

## Decision

`upgrade` gains a **release mode** and becomes the default:

- **Mode resolution:** `--source <p>` → config `source_dir` → **release mode**.
  Source users keep their flow untouched; binary users get self-update.
- **Release pipeline** (`core/release.rs`): map the running platform to an asset
  (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`; anything else →
  `ValidationError` pointing at `--source`) → `curl` tarball + `SHA256SUMS` →
  verify via `sha256sum`/`shasum -a 256` → `tar -xzf` → probe the new binary
  (`--version` — it must execute before anything is replaced) → atomic
  tmp+rename into the bin dir. Subprocess tools (`curl`, `tar`, checksum),
  no HTTP/sha2 crates — the pipeline mirrors `scripts/install.sh` line for line,
  so the two paths cannot drift. `CARPENTER_DOWNLOAD_BASE` overrides the URL
  (tests/mirrors).
- **Skill:** release mode **always (re-)registers** (`skill::register`) —
  installer parity (`install.sh` auto-registers when opencode exists), and it
  makes `upgrade` the one-command update for skill + binary. Source mode keeps
  the adr/004 contract: refresh only if registered (`not_registered` warning
  otherwise). `--no-skill` still yields `skill:null`.

## Consequences

+ Binary-installed users self-update with `carpenter upgrade`; the `skill` file
  ships the new embedded howto with it.
+ `Data::Upgrade.source` now carries the origin (source dir or tarball URL) —
  no envelope-shape change; spec 18 regenerated.
+ amd64-musl + Apple Silicon covered; Intel Mac / Windows / linux-arm64 get a
  clear `ValidationError` naming `--source` (matches installer gate).

− `upgrade` now needs `curl` + `tar` + a checksum tool on PATH in release mode
  (macOS/Linux always have them; a missing tool is a clear `StoreError`).
− Rollback safety: a failed download/verify/probe aborts **before** the binary
  is touched; a failed skill write never rolls back a successful binary swap
  (unchanged).

## Rejected

- **In-process HTTP (`ureq` + `sha2`)** — two new supply-chain deps to avoid
  subprocess tools every target platform already ships; also risks drifting
  from `install.sh`.
- **`gh`/GitHub-API aware upgrades** — needs auth for some flows; plain release
  URLs are anonymous and mirror-able via `CARPENTER_DOWNLOAD_BASE`.
- **Pinning versions / channels beyond `edge`** — YAGNI until versioned
  releases exist.
