# Data Model

SQLite is the source of truth. One `course.db` per course directory. Schema lives
in `core/db.rs` as one initial `CREATE`-based schema (a versioned `migrate` command
is deferred — [adr/010](../adr/010-live-check-state.md)); these docs are the
human-readable mirror. On conflict, the schema in `core/db.rs` wins — update these
docs to match.
